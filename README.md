## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{All of our Data used from the project was collected from a third party but all can be found directly from the NHL. The data we will be using has been collected over the last six years and contains advanced stats from games, player data including: goals, assists, PPG, penalties and more. The data has been collected to give out end of season rewards but also helps assist teams with in-depth player analysis to help change to game to a more analytical standpoint. All data is taken from human collection and then submitted into a data base for analysis.}
